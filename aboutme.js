    description: "My name is Bagas Nurdiansyah, but people usually call me Bagas. I’m a curious learner who loves diving into technology, design, and creative development. I enjoy building things from scratch, experimenting with new ideas, and sharpening my skills through real projects. For me, learning isn’t just a task it's a journey I genuinely enjoy. Lately, I’ve been developing a strong passion for React.js and continuously pushing myself toward becoming a full-stack developer, both in PHP and the MERN Stack.",
